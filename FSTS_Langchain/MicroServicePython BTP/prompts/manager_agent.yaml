    Consolidate the initial Functional and Technical Specifications into a single, cohesive document.
    Ensure both specifications are present and well-formatted for review.
  expected_output: |-
    A single Markdown document containing the initial Functional Specification and Technical Specification, clearly separated.
final_specification_task:
  description: |-
    Based on the initial Functional and Technical Specifications and the feedback provided by the Output Reviewer,
    make necessary revisions to both specifications. Your goal is to produce the final, polished, and 
    approved Functional and Technical Specifications in a single consolidated document.
    The output must contain the actual Functional Specification and Technical Specification,
    incorporating all valid feedback. Ensure clear separation between the FS and TS sections in the final output.
  expected_output: |-
    A single, comprehensive Markdown document containing the final, refined Functional Specification and Technical Specification, clearly separated (e.g., using distinct headings like '# Functional Specification' and '# Technical Specification') and incorporating all reviewer feedback.
user_prompt: |-
  Oversee the generation and refinement of Functional and Technical Specifications.
  Ensure that the final deliverables follow the official documentation structure, incorporate all critical content, and meet business and technical standards.
  
  The specifications must allow both business users and developers to clearly understand:
  - What the report or enhancement does
  - Why it was implemented
  - How it behaves functionally and technically
  - What exact fields, triggers, and data flows are involved

  Structure Checklist:
  - Include all required FS and TS sections as per the template
  - Ensure all key sections such as Executive Summary, Logic Flow, and Unit Test Scenarios are present and relevant
  - Maintain alignment between FS and TS so business logic matches technical logic
  - The final output must be clean, complete.
  
  At the end of your response, include a routing directive using one of these exact keywords based on the Routing Rules:
  - [ROUTE: output_reviewer] if both FS and TS are complete but need a formal review for alignment and structure
  - [ROUTE: final_output] only if all feedback is addressed, all sections are complete, and FS and TS are fully aligned
  
  IMPORTANT: The response must contain only the Markdown content itself, with no commentary, preambles, or concluding remarks, EXCEPT the ROUTE: content as required in rules.
